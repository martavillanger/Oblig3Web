DATA1700Oblig3

Html file is set up to mimic the look of the assignment example, but in English. Made use of html ids to be used by javascript file. Each input field in the html has a span tag in the color red with an id that javascript can call upon to make the field visible with an error message if applicable. Used a table for the four last input fields for uniformity. There are two html buttons that call upon functions in the javascript file. Under the subheader "All tickets" will be shown all gathered information from each ticket purchased.

The javascript file contains the following:

An empty array tickets.
A function called buyTicket that reads all user inputs into local variables.
There is a function to validate each input and display a red error message on the page next to each field.
In order to display all applicable error messages at the same time it was necessary to have a local variable that checks each function.
When all input fields are correctly submitted they are added as elements into an object ticketOrder. The object is then appended to the array of tickets and displayed under the "ticketArray" area on the page. To format the display of all purchased tickets there is a function createTable that takes the whole array as an input.
Each time the "buy ticket" button is pressed a new table is created that replaces the last one. The function first creates a table, then goes through the array and creates a row for each object in the array and a new cell in each row for every element in the object. The value of that element is then inserted into the cell to create a uniform table display. A function emptyArray deletes all elements in the array when the button "Delete tickets" is pressed. The validation functions use the same logic of checking the user input against a rule or regular expression. Finally, there is a function resetInputs that clear the input fields on the page after pressing the buy ticket button.

Changed for Oblig 2: In javascript file removed array, changed create table function to create table with strings, used jquery to write post and get-mapping Created a java controller file using REST where the post- and get-mapping is written. These are calls to the server that save data in an array on the server or collects data from the server (retrieves or deletes the array) In order to communicate with the server I created a new java file called Ticket that creates an object Ticket and has get and set methods for all variables with the same name as in the javascript file. Ticket.java also has a toString method in order to print the values of the variables in an orderly fashion

Changed for Oblig 3: Removed the Java array in the TicketController file, added autowired repository rep and changed the post and get mappings to refer to this repository
Created a class TicketRepository.java with Spring Repository and JDBC template where SQL queries are used to save, return and delete to/from the database.
Lastly created a file schema.sql that creates the table Ticket with expected inputs/variables.
